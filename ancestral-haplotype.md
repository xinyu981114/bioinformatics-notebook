# How to find ancestral haplotype 
The ancestral haplotype is the haplotype of **a most recent common ancestor** deduced by comparing descendants' haplotypes and eliminating mutations.  
A minimum of three lines, as distantly related as possible, is recommended for deducing the ancestral haplotype. This process is known as **triangulation**.
